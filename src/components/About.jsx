        </h2>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
          I am a transfer student currently in my final year of study, working full-time while completing my degree.
          Balancing academics and employment has taught me time management, dedication, and focus. When I find downtime,
          I enjoy playing basketball and studying the game by watching film of professional players â€” not just to enjoy it but also to expand my skillset and strategic understanding.
